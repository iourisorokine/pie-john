# pie-john
Mini-game in P5 JS featuring a pigeon named john.

The game was created based on a tutorial about creating a "Flappy Bird" game, with inexisting graphics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY
Enhancements:
- Pigeon designed and wings are animated (waaaaa!)
- Pipes transformed in a flat ground
- Health level that drops down rapidly when ground is touched
- Food level, that replenishes when the bird eats seeds
- When the bird has eaten, it can poop
- Regular square target appear and hitting them with the poop makes you score points
- The bird has 3 levels depending on the amount of food, higher levels means powerful poop but also trickier flying physics
